/**
 * The template from which `run.ts` is generated.
 *
 * Why autogenerate run.ts?
 * - Avoids hardcoding all test names. Now, adding a new test case is as simple as
 *   dropping a new file into the repository.
 * - Avoids hardcoding all backend factory names. (Ditto.)
 *
 * Previously, the code used RequireJS modules to dynamically grep for and require
 * tests and factories. However, Browserify does not allow you to have dynamic module
 * dependencies, as it prevents bundling. Thus, I compromised with this file.
 * (It's also less hacky, as now things will be typechecked at bundle-time. :) )
